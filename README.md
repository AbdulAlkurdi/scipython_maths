# scipython_maths
A repository of small maths projects explored with Python.

The projects in this repository are described in more detail on the [scipython blog](https://scipython.com/blog/) which accompanies my book, [Learning Scientific Programming with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Scientific-Programming-Python-Christian/dp/1107075416/)
